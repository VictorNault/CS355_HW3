Instructions for compiling:
run the following commands:
make clean
make kais_shell

How to run:
run the following command:
./kais_shell

Known bugs and limitation:
When parsing ; if you put it in ";" your string will be broken by the semi-colon.
We have a race condition whenever a child sends multiple SIGCHLD signals in (very) short succession. For example,
when cat is suspended, and it is restarted with bg, cat immediately resuspends, sending a SIGCONT signal and
a SIGTSTP/SIGSTOP. But if our signal handler is not done with the SIGCONT yet, it will fail to pick up the stop
signal, and thus not update the "is_suspended" flag in its entry in our linked list.

Features and extra credit completed:
you can start multiple backgrounded tasks using ; which differs from the linux terminal

File Directory:
commands.c/h: containing code for built in functions fg, bg, jobs, kill
design.c: our original design
kais_shell.c: contains the parser, uses readline that takes command from commandline, forks off a child, and runs command
List_Extras.c/h: contains methods for the LinkedList for the ProcessProps struct, such as deleting a ProcessProp, or finding it by pid or jobid
List.c/h: contains implementation and methods for a linked list data structure
node.c/h: contains implementation and methods for a node data structure
Process_Props.c/h: contains implementation and methods for Process_Props struct, containing flags relevant to a process
Sighandlers.c: contains the sigchldhandler that catches any SIGCHLD sent from children processes and updates the linked list
string_extras.c/h: contains a function to trim strings
